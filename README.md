# ABOUT-ME

My name is Jacob and I am currently a Computer Science student at UKSW in Warsaw.

I am interested both in hardware and software. I enjoy working on thinkpads, modding them and tinkering. But a nice PC build gives me joy too. 

Recently discovered that for me, Windows isnt't the best environment for coding. I prefer linux, mostly arch derived distros.

Working on learning as much usefull technologies as I can. Currently busy working on my Python and JS knowledge. I also try to keep C++ alive, as It gives me soo much fun while using it. Just it's strict nature and rules makes it work a treat for my scientific mind.
